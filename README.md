## Introduction
Diwali is one of the most significant festivals in India, and understanding consumer behavior during this period can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies. This project explores the purchasing habits of a specific demographic—married women aged 26-35—across different states and product categories.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following columns:
- **User_ID**: Unique identifier for each user
- **Cust_name**: Customer name
- **Product_ID**: Unique identifier for each product
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Age Group**: Age group of the customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Shaadi**: Marital status (1 for married, 0 for unmarried)
- **State**: State of the customer
- **Zone**: Geographical zone of the customer
- **Occupation**: Occupation of the customer
- **Product_Category**: Category of the product purchased
- **Orders**: Number of orders placed
- **Amount**: Total amount spent

## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values.
2. **Data Transformation**: Converted data types where needed (e.g., Amount to integer).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized gender distribution and purchasing power.
   - Analyzed purchasing patterns by age group and marital status.
   - Examined the relationship between product categories and consumer demographics.

## Key Findings
- Most buyers were females, indicating significant purchasing power among women.
- Married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka predominantly purchased products in the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
- Women working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors exhibited higher spending patterns during the festival.
