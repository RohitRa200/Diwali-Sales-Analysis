## Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed unnecessary columns and handled missing values.

   - Analyzed purchasing patterns by age group and marital status.
   - Examined the relationship between product categories and consumer demographics.

- Married women aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka predominantly purchased products in the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
- Women working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors exhibited higher spending patterns during the festival.
